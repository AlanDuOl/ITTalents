# ITTalents
This repo is composed of two projects: a unit test project called 'UnitTest' and the main project called
'EasyTelents'. It also contains the Visual Studio solution for both projects a license file and this README.md file.

## EasyTalents Project
The main project 'EasyTelents' is a talent bank for developers. It allows a user to register and create a profile with personal and professional information.
It also has default 'Admin' user that can list the developers.

## Technical details
This project has been developed from a template that creates a basic structure and a built-in authentication/authorization system.
I have only made some small changes in the authorization guard to restrict access by roles.

The template for this project has been created following this guide:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization?view=aspnetcore-3.1

The project is composed of a front-end built with AngularJS and a RESTFull API built with .NET Core 3.1.

### API
- The database model is created using Entity Framework Core 3.1 with a Database Context and Data Models.
- The database is created/updated using Migrations.
- The database is accessed using the repository pattern through the Controllers.
- The data is retrieved from the database using the lazy-loading technique.
- The API uses the NLog package to log errors and information to files.

### Front-end
- The pages are styled with Bootstrap and Angular Material.
- The form are built with reactive forms.
- There is an exception handler system that logs front-end errors to the API.

### 1.2 - Open the project with Visual Studio
- Open the project:
	1. Open the folder 'ITTalents'.
	2. Double click 'EasyTalents.sln' file inside the 'ITTalents' folder.
	3. Wait for the project to load on Visual Studio (you should see a 'ready' message on the bottom left of Visual Studio).

### 1.3 - Configure the database connection
- Default configuration:
	- The default configuration is set to use a SqlServer connection.
	- If you are going to use Microsoft Sql Server Express you don't need to make any changes, jump to section 1.4.
- To use a SQL Server other than Microsoft Sql Server Express:
	- Open 'appsettings.json' file in the root of 'EasyTalents' project and change the connection string value of the 'DefaultConnection' property inside 'ConnectionStrings' object to target you server connection.
	- Install your database provider in 'EasyTalents' with NuGet or Package Manage Console.
- To use SqLite database:
	1. Open Startup.cs file in 'EasyTalents' root
	2. Locate the 'ConfigureServices' method.
	3. Inside 'ConfigureServices' locate 'services.AddDbContext' call.
	4. Inside 'services.AddDbContext' replace 'options.UseSqlServer' for 'options.UseSqlite' keeping the rest the same.
	5. Inside 'options.UseSqlServer' locate 'Configuration.GetConnectionString' method call and replace the parameter 'DefaultConnection' for 'SqliteConnection'.
		- Example: 
			Change this: options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")).UseLazyLoadingProxies(),
			to this: options.UseSqlite(Configuration.GetConnectionString("SqliteConnection")).UseLazyLoadingProxies().

### 1.4 - Create the database
