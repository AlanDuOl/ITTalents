# 1.3 - Configure the database connection

- The 'EasyTalents' project is configured to use SqLite and SqlServer.
- The default behaviour is to use a SqlServer connection.
- If you are going to use Microsoft Sql Server Express you don't need to make any changes, just create the database.
- To use a different Sql Server:
	- Open the project solution with Visual Studio.
	- Open appsettings.json file in the root of 'EasyTalents' project and change the connection string value of
the 'DefaultConnection' property inside 'ConnectionStrings' object.
	- Install your database provider with NuGet.
- To use SqLite database go to Startup.cs file in 'EasyTalents' root and change the database connection in 'ConfigureServices' method.
Inside 'services.AddDbContext' call:
	- Replace the method call 'options.UseSqlServer' for 'options.UseSqlite' keeping the rest the same;
	- In 'Configuration.GetConnectionString' method call, replace the parameter 'DefaultConnection' for 'SqliteConnection';
	- Ex: 
		Change this: options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")).UseLazyLoadingProxies(),
		to this: options.UseSqlite(Configuration.GetConnectionString("SqliteConnection")).UseLazyLoadingProxies()


# 1.4 - Create the database
	1. Open the projects Solution with Visual Studio
	2. Open the Package Manager Console - PMC (it can be found in View menu of Visual Studio).
	3. Make sure 'EasyTalents' is the default project inside PMC window bar.
	4. Type 'Update-Database' and hit enter. If everything goes right you should see a 'Done' output in the console.


# 1.5 - Build 'EasyTalents' project
- Go to 'EasyTalents' project file, right click it and choose the 'build' option it the pop-up menu.
	- This will install the project depencies with npm package manager for the Angular client (this will take a while).
	- When the build is finished you can run the project.
